The first bit of paper hung up on my walls was an unfolded map of the world. Relatively current for 1980-something. The map preceded band photograph rip-outs and skateboard magazine photos. Where will I go, and what will I discover is out there in the nebulae?

Everybody wants to leave and nobody wants to stay. It’s the damned staying that matters. I am convinced I can fly even if it is not here in corporal form. I am convinced there’s a dark mark on my heart that scratches and claws to salvage despair from the bosom of happiness. All these wonderful people who try and help me, and I fight it all. Let me have my moment(s) of sadness so it may pass through me, and only I will remain.

Trust me. I am keenly aware of how lucky I am to be alive. I do not take this world for granted, and chances are high that I love you. Yes, you.
