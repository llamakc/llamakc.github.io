4/1/2020 – Body-wide muscle soreness arrived today. I walk a couple miles a day at the most, and haven’t been skating or exercising. Not clear why the exhaustion. . .

4/2/2020 – Aches were ghost symptoms. Nothing today except the regular crack, strain, and throb of a skateboarder’s body halfway to one hundred years old. The relief is palpable although those around me won’t notice a change in my surliness or sadness. Some clocks tick slower.

4/3/2020 – No fever. Took time to reconnect with the people and person(s) that I needed/wanted to. The death numbers rise. The anxiety and fear climbs. The days are sunny and mild, teasing us from our retreat inside.

4/11/2020 – Time was never real and we knew that even though everyone pretended it mattered. My mother has been moved to hospice care, and because of the COVID-19 global pandemic I will not be able to see her again. Parkinson’s and other ailments have taken her mobility, her voice. The mind and humor still sparks behind her eyes (the last time I saw her, April 2019). I owe, I owed, I will owe her better.

4/12/2020 – Memory was never reliable. I don’t trust the NOW.

4/13/2020 – I am afraid.

4/14/2020 – And today delivered fever and a raspy cough. This is exhaustion and not malaise. I do not remember smiling. Worn down from sinus attacks and seesawing between chills and (being) overly warm.

4/14/2020 (end of day) – Just fear in my gut. Anxiety causing physical ills. My Mother is at The End. I will never be ready for these next days.

4/15/2020 – Dread. I spoke today with calm, reposed. She heard me over my brother’s speaker. “It’s okay, it is okay.”

4/16/2020 – I am now in the last half of this life. Goodbye, mother.

4/20/2020 – Her body has been cremated.

4/21/2020 – This slow-motion apocalypse–and what bad timing for a cry that will not come.

4/21/2020 – 15:54 CST – Despair.

4/22/2020 – The place where wind goes when all is still. You were never here to begin with. We keep each day empty until eventide when everything vanished reverses course. The river is high again this year.

4/23/2020 – Plenty of work and a year where many have nothing. Kept me busy enough to not feel the cloak of depression. Ah, there you are, old friend.

4/24/2020 – The New Orleans Saints Super Bowl win really was one of the most fulfilling and exciting days of this life. Wish I would have shared it with my mother. The rest of days are just useless. . .

4/25/2020 – Almost a full day passed and felt normal. The slightest gesture or phrasing, song or interaction just removes any armor that I’ve created.

4/26/2020 – Everyone is fine. It’s the Pandemic. It’s their problems. It’s what they can’t go do. The world is about how you interact with it, not it with you. Nobody cares any longer. The loneliness may get worse and the crippling guilt may gather at the border, but nobody rides at daybreak to save you. Get used to it. You’ve known this all along anyhow.

4/27/2020 – I hear friends complain about missing their lifestyle in overly emotional pleas across social media. They miss being noticed, and validated. It makes sense. The void lets no prisoner escape. The final singularity where you have gone. I miss you. Perhaps we meet on the sidewalk in a city at the edge of daybreak, when it is the coldest and the birds shake their wings. Perhaps I make the same mistake and don’t notice who you are, and really were.

4/28/2020 – Each single morning a Sisyphean task. The afternoon a half-nap. I can’t leave this place. I don’t want to. I thought I would feel different when these days came.

4/29/2020 – Time wasted in vain is solely on me. I will not visit these demons on others, or attempt to hold accountable for what was my sole failure(s). And I can not let that happen again. Time back home has cut its hurting blade with every bit of fun I’ve had. The give &amp; take. I won’t let this happen again.

4/30/2020 – “How are you feeling (this morning, today, during all of this)?”

*My mother died two weeks ago. That’s how I am doing.*

Goodbye April. Let there be lilacs.
