<pre class="wp-block-verse">Shuffle all y'all Polaroids for the cut-fresh hand. Them skeletons dance before break fast. He/him picked marigolds from the neutral ground for her crown
--O queen of daybreak or/and prince of knives 
where is yor' magick 
     bag of mushroom dust? Where went the kick-drums that kept time inside our boomerang of hearts?

Tell us the barber's chair 
which nicks ankle and kneecap. Spin & sit & 
spit & nip at the Irish creams and hot Toddys before 
the port-o-lets transform this East Bank Tardis--FULL STOP

whisked away to the staccato knocking from the next person, or persons, who request relief by evacuation or consumption

STUMBLE again into faceless crowds of everyone you now know. The living-- the living---of what the long dance is.
