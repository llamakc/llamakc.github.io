Disaster District shifted again last night. The western border is now the river bridge bypass. Everything uptown from there still safe. You can still use money, get fuel and foodstuffs. Here though the lights are on a non-patterned brown out schedule that’s no schedule. If it’s down, everything just stops. The corners go hot again with bartering and arguing over every trade. Each scam and hand-to-hand conveyance a chance to get over on the other. Ya either the mark or not. Don’t get complacent. That easy life is for them back uptown. And definitely don’t get fooled by nostalgia. The best days are ahead. There was never any doubt that we’d carve out some happiness from the whole cloth of darkness.
