There was a wild man lost in the Orleans Parish jail/prison system. I know because I saw him. He did not talk. He smelled like a burnt sewer, his hair long and wild and matted. The jailers didn’t know his name, and couldn’t identify him by fingerprint. He would not talk. They moved him from bay to cut to different bay, waiting him out.

I wonder if he died in that hell.
