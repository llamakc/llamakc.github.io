NEW POEM IDEAS

accepting life as is and not what should be






<br /> 
---cold camp cookout with scratch & dent 
can of lunar-grade Sterno. Deceit of darkness 
or tinnitus, the misshapen lump of grey-greened  
potato mush falls off of the spit&#151;  
Mosquitos any blood to break the webbed 
electric nightsky---We want respected and appreciated  
while I am still able to sit happily within  
that amber warmth---coal embers over eyes  
like death stones to signal rebirth    
<br />
