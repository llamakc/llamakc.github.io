Come on with it li’l lady–ain’t nobody here thinking I’m here. Don’t tip them mufuckas off and go and get this all fucked up.

JUST let the corrections to this timeline happen. Don’t correct no shit won’t be no shit, sang the workmen to the pay-bosses e’ery goddamned day.

It’s okay to go away. It’s okay to say “hey hey, see y’all fools on the flipside. . .”

<pre class="wp-block-verse">I wanted my hair to grow
long, but the ambience 
was too much there

I wanted to walk in
this world without worry,
every conversation more
logistics of living, instead 
of the living

the planning of the planned
Were these turnaround years 
and not the miserable same

I give I give up I give in
