I did not recognize my face in the mirror. This was not some flashback or current psychedelic trip: it was years of substance abuse, and finally I saw the monster I had become. Others saw this far before I did, but course correction took *me* not seeing **me** to happen for the oars to begin paddling for different shores.

No chrysalis or sudden awareness. Just the totality of years letting myself down.It is the heaviest weight I will cast overboard.

I believe in me.
