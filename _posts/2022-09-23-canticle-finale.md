Some say the art is there already, the way a sculptor lets his labor and time do the revealing. This isn’t granite its a pair of hands wrapped in cloth or rope. You feel the ache and the fiber of it all. But what if one does not stop and it’s now bones or sticks that could be squinted at to appear as bones. You remove too much. The essence is gone. This no boat in drydock repair and replaced to be its own self of what it was or wasn’t.

This is more than reconfiguration, transfiguration. Too late to gather up the hair, shavings, paint chips, laughter, nightmare and throw it all up with a !poof! and pray you find a way back, walking in offset shoes, backward, through your own trapdoors.
