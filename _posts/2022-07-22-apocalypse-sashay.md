What’s that? Some new movie or graphic novel you picked up at the library? Yeah, prolly the only place those words still have meaning. I knew a coworker named Hope. She was kind, but made decisions she’d regret. Each weekend we would sit on the rooftop of the theatre as she would tell her most recent tale, and try her hardest to make sense of why she went wild on the weekends after work. None of my business, I’d say. And it wasn’t. But those decisions made these humans sad. I worry about her still, twenty years removed. Walk these paths long enough and it’s all a private el camino.

Ain’t never known a cat named Trust though. His enforcer prob named Humanitarian Hally. That’s like Sally with an H, and you got any cash on ya?
