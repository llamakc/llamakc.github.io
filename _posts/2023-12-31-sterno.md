<br /> 
---dream of trying to cook a large   
steak on cold night of camping with only   
a scratch & dent can of lunar-grade Sterno.  
Deceit of darkness and tinnitus, the steak  
becomes a misshapen lump of grey-green potato  
mush falling off of the spit&#151;  
The mosquitos want my blood to break  
free of the webbed electric nightsky  
---I want to feel respected and appreciated  
while I am still able to sit happily within  
that amber warmth---coal embers over eyes  
like death stones to signal rebirth    
<br />
