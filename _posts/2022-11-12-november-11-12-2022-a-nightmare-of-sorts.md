At a meeting hall, perhaps Veterans or Kiwanis or Elks Lodge. Old building with several acoustic ceiling tiles missing from the water-pocked drop ceiling. There’s an ice-chest on a plastic folding table. There’s no tablecloth and my sister is distraught. She moves about the room commenting and critiquing whatever catches her gaze. Busy work, I guess. A few loiter around the table, drinking bottled beer.

There are no chairs. I forgot them. I didn’t even try and order any.

We are at my father’s wake, or gathering. Whatever his religion would call this.

His mahogany casket is polished enough to see one’s clear reflection if close enough. I have yet to stand still, alone, in front of it, him.

I am aware of the dream. I hover a foot off of the linoleum and glide to the ice-chest. Only NA and light beers are bedded down between the crushed ice. He loves a cup of crushed ice. Not a soul is surprised at my floating around the hall. This is what he does, they realize. His sister? She frets. Ken? He flies and hopes for a chance to fly away.

My sister is at David’s casket. She is bawling, and in between heavy, wet sobs she gesticulates. She always becomes the star attraction. So many years gone now, I have come to love her peculiarities.

I begin her way. My legs are heavy as if I am dragging iron chains. I feel woozy the way one does after drinking too much and rising to walk, or leaving a bar stool. Once in the East Village I was telling some story half-made up, and gesticulating also. My feet wrapped inside of the stool’s legs. I built up steam, rocking to and fro, and then the stool tips over backward. I land ribs first on a coffee table that was crammed up near the bar’s front window nook.

Broke one rib and bruised a few other. Still didn’t let that deter my night. That’s a good memory.

I don’t see how any funeral can be carried forward as a good memory. We drag that pain along to remind us there *are* good times to come which are in stark contrast to this dark afternoon.

The sun is out. The month is December, and the dry air is just cool enough to jacket up. I wish it were raining. I wish these people did not come while I was here. I will hear story after story about a man I mythologized. I built my personality around a handful of interactions he and I shared.

For starters it is okay to be angry, but not at the people you love. AND you must let them know that you separate your frustrations from any judgment of them.

When my father and I were in some crappy part of late seventies Chicago a young man tried to mug us at knife-point. Dad told him “You better fucking kill me if you plan on sticking me with that little knife!” The first time I remember remembering him curse. The first time I was party to him protecting me from an active threat. *All of the things a parent does selfless and tirelessly behind the scenes of a large portion of our lives.*

I cursed a LOT after that, but not in his earshot. I don’t believe I uttered a curse word in his company until I was in my mid-twenties.

After the mugger decided not to engage, he jogged off and around a corner. I was scared and wanted to hold his hand. He told me “not here, not now. Never show you are afraid in public.” We got sodas from a drugstore, and he continued “fear is natural and healthy, but don’t be the weak one. You must stand tall.” Funny now that I reminisce as I was probably 4’9″ or so.

He wanted me to play intramural sports, so I did. With my lazy right eye I was a horrible batter on my Peanut League team. Not even a single foul ball. So Dad took me a handful of times to the batting cages. Made me stand in there, even though scared to try.

He said *the entirety of this life is all about the trying*. He was not wrong, after all. Our last game, the team in last place, I had what would be my final at-bat. Two missed swings, and a ball. 1-2 and I said *fuck it* and swung away. Cracked a single over the 3rd baseman’s glove. I was in shock and forgot to run to first. My father was there for that game, and he almost always had work or other reasons to miss most of my games.

I remember the fire in his eyes. A large toothy smile beaming through a 1970’s mustache. I had done good for the first time, I recollect now. Next batter up hit a line drive to the pitcher, and that was that for baseball.

My brother T. was consoling J. I came up behind and bear hugged. I remember that moment in the dream because I was there when my father’s older brother did the same to Dad and his sister at my grandmother’s viewing.

Be there for others even when you don’t think you can keep going. *You will gather strength from helping others more than you ever will from when you are in need from them.*

T. walks my sister toward the door, probably to smoke cigarettes. Nobody else has approached the casket. The dream casket is on some type of lazy susan and rotates. I didn’t question this.

He looks young. They shaved his face. In this large, final wooden box he appears to be 20% smaller, as if death had shrunk him entirely. I stood several inches over him, but I always felt so humbled and lesser in his brash, humorous presence. His cheeks weren’t puffed out in anger or laughter. He wasn’t wearing glasses, and I found that disturbing.

I reach my hand forward, but the real tears startle me awake. I am smiling and crying quietly in my bed. My best friend sleeps next to me, her dreams full of snorts and giggles.
