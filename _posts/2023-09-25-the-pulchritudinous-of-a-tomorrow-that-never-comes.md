Being sad all of the time is exhausting. I’m done. This morning traffic is loud. They repaved a few road dips &amp; depressions on our street so the vroom-vroom cars can speed by, unclutched and hauling their heavy metal occupants off to their time clocks here in Cancer Alley. *I wonder what Suzanne made me for lunch today?*

I wanted familiarity. I chose New Orleans in its broken-down post-glory condition to ride the rest of my life out. I had and don’t desire any success in business or love. I just want to slow it all down, and find a small notch in the gearing to let this living experiment run its course.

^^^ Maybe a year ago? Still same sadness.
