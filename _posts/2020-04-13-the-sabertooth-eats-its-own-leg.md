```
<pre class="wp-block-verse">One day
lizards learned
to fly and escaped
the tar pits and entrapment
where their lives were
mired in muddy asphalts
disguised as oases, or
convenience and safety
in the fauna.
These new birds drifted
on warming currents above
their brethren, peering
down at the young who
die beautiful, who are left
for the ugly toothed cats
at sediment’s edge.
Predators with an uglier
future of prejudice and pride&#151;
proud enough to become
stuck inside the trap
that caught the prey,
ignorant to the point
of wiggling down deeper
instead of up and
out, or away.
```
