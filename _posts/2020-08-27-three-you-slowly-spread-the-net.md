Guilt. Of abandonment (hers) and then that which I visited on her near the end when she needed me to just be the child I once was. That would have taken so little effort.

Not even five months yet has passed so I’m not surprised there has been no let-up in this guilt. The mania I am always a step behind now that I no longer self-medicate. The drag-down depression of boots stuck in muck, that suck sound loud in my ears. The tinnitus’ only companion.

I have trained myself to be anxious when happiness tries to backdoor itself between the moments of the day.

I don’t trust myself any longer.
