I have broken the pattern. Ten years was a long midlife crisis, and here I am on the other side of it. Many friends now dead from overdose or neglect. Marriages dissolved. Sugar never survives the storms.

Build it new. Build it with trust and forgiveness. Let the body relearn what compassion is by giving it to others first.

Selfishness is a thief. Do not confuse it with self-preservation, and damn my man do NOT let addiction get the upper hand. It will rewire you again. VROOM VROOM. The salad days are finally here.

Now go love on your people. They may not forgive you, but you sure as hell can sing your song of contrition. Only the winds may hear us on the open road.
