**Inferno: Canto I**  
Midway upon the journey of our life  
I found myself within a forest dark,  
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.  
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say  
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,  
Which in the very thought renews the fear.  
So bitter is it, death is little more;  
But of the good to treat, which there I found,  
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.  
I cannot well repeat how there I entered,  
So full was I of slumber at the moment  
In which I had abandoned the true way.

I am stowed away in the guest bathroom which will now serve as an office (of sorts) and a hideaway. I carry a heavier burden than just last week, the weight of my own Rube Goldberg Machine and something quite small in sentence structure (if I were to share) but heavier than anything known in this universe. I carry it for you. And never again will you be alone to drag \_this\_ in solitude. I got you.
