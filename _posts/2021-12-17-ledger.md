I chased all form of chimera throughout the nights of my life. Perceived, imagined, and the wisps of smoke that twist inside grey matter after nights, days, weekends, (soon) months of substance abuse. The line between when I drifted off purposely and when actual psychosis curled its tendrils around my brain stem was long erased. A shadow of pencil lead smudged on my forehead like Ash Wednesday.

I went crazy and all I got out of it was tinnitus, poor memory, an addiction to everything Iâ€™ve encountered, lost loves and found ones. An endless checklist of skateboards and music cassettes. Rough lips after Mardi Gras from every girl and boy I kissed or who kissed me.
