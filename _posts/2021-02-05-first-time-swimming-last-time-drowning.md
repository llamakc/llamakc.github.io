I am scared. I don’t remember when the mania arrived. Was it just now? How long have I been under the sheet ice? The real world right there on the other side. . .

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://lifebydictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photo_2020-11-30_12-15-54-1024x587.jpg)</figure>Make no mistake though. I am enveloped now. I’ve become what I feared in others. I run sideways in a world of up/down elevators. Boxcars moving freight here to there and clue how to go up into the buildings or recover from the basements.

Lost in the corners again.
