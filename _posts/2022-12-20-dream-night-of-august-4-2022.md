A large group of old friends and new family gathered in a park near the Outsider Art Museum, just a few blocks from downtown. Sunny day, moderately warm. Comfortable and dry. My paternal grandmother was but a bit younger than I remember and knew her. She was affable yet full of salty rejoinders. A few of my cousins, again on my father’s side, also appeared and disappeared.

This dream had no problem to solve or quest. There was no frantic escape from faceless bad guys in constant pursuit. There was no sexual tone to the dream at all. Just warmth and unending camaraderie.

We played horseshoes and someone asked about a corn-hole thing. I don’t know if this was in the past, the now, or future. Ages came and went. One moment a friend was young, and the next in their 30’s or 40’s. I did not learn the rules of corn-hole in any decade I’ve passed through.

I showed them that I could fly. One wills it so. I held a few of their hands and we flew around our gathering⁠—never higher than a cheap kite. Most wanted to try⁠—none asked how. Nobody cares about *the process* any more.

My paternal grandmother and I talked privately. Said she was ready to date again, and more so than that, reclaim her sex life. Later she said in a circle of the women that she wanted to visit an adult XXX store to purchase a few toys. My uncle gasped with a wince. Someone I don’t know or remember offered to bring her soon. I remember her smile in the dream and in my memories of visiting her. So kind to me. I wonder what dirty deeds were scattered through her past.

I feel like I’m tumbling into the abyss when I fly or float. The firmament only a few feet below yet I felt an anxious fear each time. What if I am too high, or the ground opens up to swallow me, gone for good one final last time?

I hope I see these people in dreams again. This was the most content I’ve been in so very long. I am lucky to have remembered even this much of it.

I do not recall dreams/nightmares where I don’t fly. My mother said my bones were filled with helium. We carry those falsehoods far into our adult life. When I am out in public and feel anxious I try to fly. Tense my shoulders and internally command myself: *UP!*

It will work in this lifetime. I am sure of it.
