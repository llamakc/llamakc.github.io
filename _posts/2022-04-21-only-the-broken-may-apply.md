Perhaps it was a gust of wind, but I would stake my life on this: it was the Hand of the Unknown that pulled me back to the Living. Call it whatever you want, in any language. I know I was touched, and that I matter.

I am different, and will flourish and succeed. In this I give thanks, and alms.

A breath away from passing through, a stumble down a stairwell or heart attack when nobody is around. Float out and up and away. A chimera wrapped in late April fog stretched thin from the river, across the battlefield and cemetery to my front and back door. The wrap-around of memory and forgetfulness.

The only path I wasnâ€™t afraid of was wanton self-destruction and neglect. I have lost weight and direction. I have retooled the pathways in the brain to confuse and torture myself.

I am here by the grace of LIVING, and I will not let this life be lost again.
