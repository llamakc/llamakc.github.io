DREAMSCAPE: Forced into hand-to-hand combat over a drunken insult that was only cast in response to a much younger man heckling my friend. The law is the law in all parts of the land. None escape\* (see Escape Clause below–must have Palladium-level access to view)

No one is an exception\* (see Exception Clause below–must have Silver-level access to view)

The first time the jail intake door closes I was shocked at the loudness. Every time since it isn’t the hollow echoed clack that shocks me. It is a worm of fear that I will never get back out. The worm eats through my guts, wraps my heart tightly, makes way to twist my tongue against me.

I have always been my own worst enemy, and I have another solid 48 years in me to go.

I’m just getting started, motherfuckers.

I remember the kisses. I remember the goodbyes. I remember the bus pulling out of the station at dawn.
