لست متأكدًا من أنني أريد البقاء في علاقتنا.

This life has become a dark reflection of summer after school. The long days and lack of friends. Just an overabundance of nothingness broken up by scattered and fragmented television. My reading list dwindled from lack of interest, and I just began coasting through life with no sadness or joy. Impotence of spirit.

***Here I am again.*** Loveless(ed) and sad–the only change to my routine is choosing which chores to do in what order. Walk the dog. Fold the clothes. Wash dishes. Clean the bathrooms. Walk the dog. Repeat ad infinitum. I don’t remember tenderness or laughter. I am brittle to the touch and mean-spirited in any response. I hate myself.

I hate myself.

So much more of the *World* for me to experience. I may be struggling with heavy depression and ideation of quitting this all, but no way in HELL will I let myself confuse entrapment, imprisonment, and morass of spirit and body. I am my biggest chain and shackle. No one else. I am the enemy. I am that which must be conquered, again.

And again. And again.
