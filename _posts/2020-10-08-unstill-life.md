I just don’t know how I and everything I understand fell apart, so quickly. . .

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">![](https://lifebydictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-10-08_12-41-02-768x1024.jpg)</figure>The dead are forgotten. Perhaps the moment before or after the forgetfulness we remember them. But ultimately we survive by letting go.

The friends who have gone before me I have let fall into the tide of memory.

I am unable to let my mother’s death go. I am not well.
