I feel myself giving up. I am watching, detached, *a ghost’s ghost,* myself through a fun mirror that brings no joy. Every action is partially delayed or obscured. There’s less and less to see or hear or remember.

That’s the trick: personality removal one sliced aspect or trait at a time. Eventually there’s only a bland core, and that makes the final deletion much easier. Human nature abhors boredom.

***The first cut was the last cut.***
