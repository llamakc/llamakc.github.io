Tracked like cattle. Seeds for next season’s planting–left in a drawer with plastic buttons and zip-ties. A sub-number on a downward trending plan of inaction.

Where did you go? Why were you parked out front tonight? Speeding off. Alone? Loneliness.

Crack your phones into tiny pieces. Eat the sim card with oat milk to wash it down. Who needs Valium in this world of gut punch after haymaker?
