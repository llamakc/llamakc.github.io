Tell me if affection hides in the spare   
of middle night between laundry sinked    

and dishes clang the dryer&#151;rakish shoes    
futureless in recline for early coffee cups    

*I find your hair in the strangest of best places*  
Ask me where I've been when I appear lost  

Songbirds tap claggy windows to trade heartburn   
heart again for coin or loose cigarettes while  

*antecessor ex machina* hold a grawlix world  
stone mute to declare right of first survival

Tell me the tugboat's cockcrow wakes us  
to crashed cars, a trashcan cantata outside

Ask me if sadness begins or ends here   
as the brinicles run in reverse; ask me  

if this takes longer to admit:  
love always runs reverse
