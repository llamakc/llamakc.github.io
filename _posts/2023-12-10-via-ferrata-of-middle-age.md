Tell me if our affection hides in the spare   
of middle night between lazy laundry sinked    

and dishes clanging in the dryer&#151;rakish socks  
futureless shoes recline for an early coffee pot  

*I find your hair in the strangest of best places*  
Ask me where I've been when I appear lost  

Crows tap a claggy window to trade heartburn   
heart again for coin or loose cigarettes while  

*antecessor ex machina* hold our grawlix world  
stone mute and declare right of first survival

Tell me the tugboat's cockcrow wakes us  
to crashed cars, a trashcan cantata outside

and our ~~gerrymandered exclusion zones  
dissolve; work back to affection~~      
4  

5  
Ask me if sadness begins or ends here;   
the brinicles run in reverse; ask me  

did this take too long to admit:  
3  

4

~~porous veil of fever dreams~~ 
  
~~generational curses
another dream you never wake from&#151;  
tinnitus vs unborn heartbeat ultrasound
...  
Tell me~~

<br/>
~~and to share a dream of third grade
in October&#151;Mrs. Kunde's class won
the largest pumpkin contest and Brandon
spent an entire afternoon with pencils
stabbing its Titian skin
the rot grew and nobody said anything
Linda whose Mom brought these German
pastries we dunked in jellies and sugars
thought I was the source of the smell
since I sat closest to our prized pumpkin.
I never kissed her and I thought I didn't 
think about her lost kiss or the pumpkin
but here I am telling you of unrequited love
and how another boy always ruins a good thing~~
