Tell me if our affection hides in the spare   
of middle night between lazy laundry sinked    

and dishes clanging in the dryer&#151;rakish socks  
futureless shoes in recline for an early coffee pot  

*I find your hair in the strangest of best places*  
Ask me where I've been when I appear lost.  

Crows tap the claggy window to trade heartburn   
heart again for coins or loose cigarettes while  

*antecessor ex machina* hold this grawlix world  
stone mute and declare right of first survival.

Tell me  if the cockcrow tugboat blast gapes  
each porous veil of fever dreams to . . .  
  
~~~Pull apart the entire above four lines and personalize PLEASE~~~




~~generational curses
another dream you never wake from&#151;  
tinnitus vs unborn heartbeat ultrasound
...  
Tell me~~

~~and to share a dream of third grade
in October&#151;Mrs. Kunde's class won
the largest pumpkin contest and Brandon
spent an entire afternoon with pencils
stabbing its Titian skin
the rot grew and nobody said anything
Linda whose Mom brought these German
pastries we dunked in jellies and sugars
thought I was the source of the smell
since I sat closest to our prized pumpkin.
I never kissed her and I thought I didn't 
think about her lost kiss or the pumpkin
but here I am telling you of unrequited love
and how another boy always ruins a good thing~~
