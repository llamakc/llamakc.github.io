Tell me where affection hides   
in the spare of middle night   
between dirty laundry sinked  
and dishes to clang in the dryer&#151;  
my rakish socks, futureless shoes

FREEWRITE  
inclined for tomorrow's coffee pot 
and to share a dream of third grade
in October&#151;Mrs. Kunde's class won
the largest pumpkin contest and Brandon
spent an entire afternoon with pencils
stabbing its Titian skin
the rot grew and nobody said anything
Linda whose Mom brought these German
pastries we dunked in jellies and sugars
thought I was the source of the smell
since I sat closest to our prized pumpkin.
I never kissed her and I thought I didn't 
think about her lost kiss or the pumpkin
but here I am telling you of unrequited love
and how another boy always ruins a good thing

*I find your hair in the strangest of best places*
