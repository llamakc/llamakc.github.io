<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Transit</strong>

Late year rains relax and we wander
between the bright-bake humidity

—that reflection in the puddle isn't you
You are moonset and star turn—each ripple

asks we the nonesuch should gather any loose
receipts, parking tickets and never-phoned

numbers and send them into every
swirl of October the Ninth each season;

let it go; an evening sun glows inside you
still, in any dark night, and across the crowd

I just take all that you are, in —the only
feather of hope. The best good one.

A beginning that closes the endings.
