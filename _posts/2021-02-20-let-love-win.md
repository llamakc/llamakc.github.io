You showed me how to dock a large boat at an overcrowded pier. The celestial timing of it all. The sun, moon, and Jupiter’s faint reflection just through the fire-ravaged tree break. Behind us the next StratoSpaceLiner stood dick-hard forward for the morning’s space launch.

All these occurrences and still mouths to feed here in the town. Cities in ruin. Countries completely cut off from the connected world by choice or embargo.

At the center of all these levels of hell is where heaven waits.
