5/1/2020 – By large (and many small) miracles I am alive.

5/2/2020 – I miss the dead but not the living.

5/3/2020 – First day in weeks that I’ve not privately sobbed.

5/4/2020 – Another not-miserable start today. Here’s to holding on to hope.

5/5/2020 – Down bad

Leaving this series as-is. No dailies rolled under one post. Tomorrow is Mothers Day and reminiscing is deleterious to my well-being. I will drag the dread behind me by its dark chains for the rest of these days. No escape, no attempt.

How may I ever be intimate with others if my most accomplished and polished trait is lying to myself? All of us just lack-lust love zombies caught on spindles of this slow motion apocalypse. . .
