I see nothing positive in any future. Might as well mine the depths of depression and see how far down I can fall. . .

That was true for the briefest sliver of a moment. It does not hold and does not define me. So exactly *when &amp; where* does definition of self begin?

Must be in every transit. The vacillated head turn that checks for oncoming traffic with worry. Back and forth and again. It was never the good of you that etched your character and it will never be the sour moments you choose to forget, either. It is the boredom of the in-between and what you do with **that** portion of time.

We are in the middle and alive. Enjoy the ride. It ends too soon no matter how many years you survive.
