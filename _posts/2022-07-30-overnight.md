I’m left with soreness, and a fear of no future. Who would desire private counsel? The cameras swivel, the shutters clack. The omni-mics pick up every utterance of disgust. They know your thoughts before the conclusions have a chance to congeal in that noodled-gravy case on your bobbily-assed neck.

I don’t like any of this, and do not like who I am.
