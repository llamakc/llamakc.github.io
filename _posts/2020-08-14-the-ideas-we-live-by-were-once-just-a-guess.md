End of September I will have lived (mostly) a cleaner life. Sober almost the entirety of. But Not completely and I have to be honest with myself first.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://lifebydictionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/takeme-880x1024.jpeg)<figcaption>Take me to a world I wonâ€™t know</figcaption></figure>Four a.m. coffee and a light breakfast. Wake, brew, browse social media to see the shenanigans old friends have been getting into while I tossed and turned lost between dream, nightmare, semi-awake and permanent loneliness/lust.  
Four-oh-seven a.m. and another listen through of OK COMPUTER.

I miss dancing and laughter and I am forgetting what excitement human touch once brought.
