I am tired. Not enough for suicide, but the wear and tear of life keeps on piling up. It’s the now and the yesterday of it all. That nothing will change for a very long time. All I can do is go to sleep, wake up, and try again.

It really is not worth it though. This is how I know I have become a dullard. I am not even wise enough or brave enough to just move along to the come-what-may.

The ghosts of my indecision will haunt this world forever. That is legacy. What you did not do. Who you gave up on. When you walked away instead of doing the hard, internal work.

Today I will loathe myself more than yesterday. Never give up on giving up.

I am 52 and I have reached downward to my 16 year-old weight. I’m not even abusing anything. I’m just sad, and hungry, and neglect my hunger. To waste away is to offer no resistance, and to let the Natural Path do its unending work. Let me unwind this consciousness and ego. Let slip the tendrils of desire and anger clean from my grasp.

Even love doesn’t matter in the end.
