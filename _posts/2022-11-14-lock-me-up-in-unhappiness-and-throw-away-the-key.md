Give this time to grow before the rot sets in. *YOU HAVE ONLY KNOWN MEMORIES*.

All the happiness and sadness is the reiteration of the last time you conjured up the thoughts in your head of whatever you believe, right now, was that happiness or sadness.

You remember the idea of a thing and not a thing.

Let the rot win. Thereâ€™s no hope.
