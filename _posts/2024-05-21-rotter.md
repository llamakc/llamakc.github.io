Maybe it was the year the cicadas all emerged. Not all of them, but convergence of a couple big number
brood overlapped. Or around that summer when the city paid a contractor to rebuild from Main Street to Main
Avenue, and paid a contractor to tear up from Main to Main. Maybe the next year the last time it was
navigable. Hard to say or concentrate on time. Foci fade as the rattle-can hum of tinnitus weighs down 
thought and wedges . . . 




<br /> 
---cold camp cookout with scratch & dent 
can of lunar-grade Sterno. Deceit of darkness 
or tinnitus, the misshapen lump of grey-greened  
potato mush falls off of the spit&#151;  
Mosquitos any blood to break the webbed 
electric nightsky---We want respected and appreciated  
while I am still able to sit happily within  
that amber warmth---coal embers over eyes  
like death stones to signal rebirth    
<br />
