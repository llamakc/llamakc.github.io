*It is not paranoia to think everyone else is incompetent.* Pizza-Drugs kicked a soft pack of cigarettes off of the sidewalk and into a puddle, scintilla of light across its oily sheen.

*Some anem?* Pulled the curtains in the one room living room/front room tight so he wouldnâ€™t think I was home. I had to pinch the flapping curtains to the wall with books at the floor. Check and check and recheck the traffic or pedestrian Pizza-Drugs type of noise. Double back and fix the books acting as anchor. Back and forth and forward again. Pizza-Drugs was lurking the block.

Let me tell ya about Pizza-Drugs. The summer midge flies, termites, and love bugs are everywhere. The streetlights yellowish glare is obscured with the living halo of short-term life. Wings and guts is all this universe ever was. He is too. I give in and answer the door. We cut bait from my studio apartment and make way across the blacktop highway into a small motorcycle bar made of concrete blocks. No fancy woodwork or copper bar-top, just beer from a cooler and a few well bottles of liquor.
