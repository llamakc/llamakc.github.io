The dream-child is mine for such a parted-second, and then it is my brother’s and I’m in charge of his pasty, ginger, plump toddler, and then this Jr. and I are at some theme park with my brother and his existing family of son, daughter, wife.

Jr. and I share some cotton candy. The wisps melt-disappearing in our mouths. Sugary smiles and sticky noses. I should apply some sunscreen to him. This heat is brutal for anybody, and he’s so pale. The blood seems closer to his washed-white skin. Splotches fight with scrapes and a toddler’s rough and tumble manner.

We see TC on the other side of the water flume ride and wave. I wave. Jr. stares at a young girl being led on a leash by her mother. Jr. points and tilts the head the same way my dog does. We desire understanding.

I’m allowed to bring Jr. on a octopus-armed ride even though he’s under the height requirement. “*On your lap, sir, on the lap!”* Soon as the ride starts I slide him to my right into the empty seat, and unbuckle and fasten the belt around his waist.

“Hang on and let it be scary!” My words meet his tearing eyes. I grab his hand and pull him secured to me. The ride picks up the pace. Our stomachs are coming and going. He’s afraid. “Grit your teeth and grab my hand tightly. Look at me!” I implore him.

The first set of fast drops and rises and his tension remains steady. No crying. He’s got this.

Dreams let everything go wrong. I am now back in line and watching Jr. with my brother on the ride, and Jr. is laughing and in full escapist rapture.

There are three college ladies behind me. The redhead points at Jr. and makes some comment out of my earshot. That’s my ignition point.

“He’s with me.” A sarcastic version of smiling. Her eyes signal she heard me. “Or that’s my nephew, I mean.”

“Oh how cute! That’s his dad? He’s a hottie,” she says in a flat and unimpressed cadence.

The first defense: always be unimpressed, and I only know to return the same. “Y’all look bored. Been here long?” I drop the park map on accident. Her friend picks it up, hands it to me, and smiles. Okay, a planned accident. Life is a series of planned accidents and apologies.

***Dreamshift***: I’m on the Gravitron and the reddish-brunette friend is pressed against me while the ride forces us back. I’ve rolled to my side and my hand is against her hip. The jeans feel well-washed. She has a fleck of light in her dark eyes. A smile.

The ride ends and she and I stay on while her friends stumble off to regain their composure. We are spinning away from this Earth. This is like dancing when all of the other bodies have disappeared, the lights pulse in sequence only for you. The pattern and rhythm of the song is yours alone. Yours and the person you dance with. The single moment of NOW when all the water bills and broken promises no longer exist. There is the dance of what is right now. That describes your entire past and their entire future. Right there, close enough to sweat against each other. The kiss that lets mouths meet.

What’s better is just after the kiss: that locked-in eye-to-eye tractor beam that says in plain language: we are together now, and connected.

I dunno. Maybe it is just me. Maybe I find manufactured meaning in dancing with strangers who become friends, or find hidden desire while dancing with friends. I am multitudes. I am now. ***DREAMSHIFT***

I can not find my nephew who may be my son. The park fills up with bodies. I can’t remember his name. The employees keep asking questions. I feel as if I’m scrutinized. I know my brother will arrive any moment with worry.

He was right here, sweaty and complaining about a headache. He took his tiny shirt off and put it on his head. I turned my head to find the three college girls and Jr. was gone.

What do I miss in my past? Who do I wish was still here? I know and won’t say. I don’t know and say too much.

I let selfishness ruin most of thirty years of living. Thinking it would all equal out in the end. It does not. The only thing that carries weight is the love you give others, and that has no tincture of lust or desire. Just be good.
