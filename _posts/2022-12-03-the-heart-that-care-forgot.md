## or: Sadness as a Service &amp; Not a Bug

I can not unwind the spinning top. Each gyroscopic motion in play. Think about your life: the day’s circular rhythm, the calendar as long game, this privatized planet spinning around the sun and the sun circling the galaxy’s center.

The heart does not wind up after depletion. It is not a child’s plaything even though most people treat it as such.

We do not know what is beyond the singularity. Like love of all things there is only the guessing and the hope.

This is why despair always wins. We do not know.

## AND I AM NOT DEPRESSED. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.
