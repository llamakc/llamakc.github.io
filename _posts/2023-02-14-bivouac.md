Christopher tried again to spin a soggy cardboard drink coaster on the baby-shit green laminate bar.

“You’re barely trying and you’re not even drunk yet. Why even bother?” Lew asked after a short, deep burp.

“Yes I am.” Chris flicked the same coaster and it flopped over the edge into something wet. “Minimally, but trying.” He pulled another coaster from the stack near the tiny straws and napkins. “You still think this is about laziness.” He raised two fingers in the bartender’s direction. “Not even close. This, this I know–it’s about the least amount of effort in *any* attempt at a task–any task. That’s the point. My method isn’t lazy, and listen, real talk, it takes a hell of a lot of non-effort to be so damn sub-par.” Finished his warm beer. “If you’d start to stop trying, you’ll see the light.”

Lew pushed his lunch plate back, adding another scratch to the bar-top and grabbed the fresh beer from the bartender’s tattooed hand. He wondered what the finger tats read or meant. Only saw S, L, and finally T on the pinky. The left ring finger was messy with lines this way and that, and he moved too quickly for Lew get a good look without being creepy. *Big fucking hands though.*
