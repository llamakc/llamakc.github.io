My back porch, looking east at the sunrise. Coffee black and a crisp, cool late winter morning. The roosters are signaling another fifteen minutes have elapsed. They are not keepers of real time, or the pretense of time in any way.

I have given up yet again. That may be my singular constant in this life. The art of rebooting myself in one way or another. Today I have a mustache. Tomorrow? I don’t know. I give thanks for the promise of tomorrow each morning in my own way. Prayers for the multiverse. Prayers for this moment.

Let today not be an argument. May I wrap myself up in the cloak of loneliness and find warmth. May I not get shackled by nostalgia, or trapped in the labyrinth of memory. Today is today, and that is a gift. Today is my gift to myself.
