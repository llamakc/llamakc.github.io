You did this all to yourself. You were not tricked or pulled up to the crossroads. Failure or falling in any direction happens at the same rate:

***q u i c k l y.***

You did this to yourself. Look back at the wake of destruction or let-down. The telltale eddies and tidewater fuck-all full of your deceit and self-preservation.

You did this to yourself. So when memory begins its opaque screen-slide into this “real” world do not be surprised. Please accept yourself and just choose a direction. You can do any of this for yourself.
