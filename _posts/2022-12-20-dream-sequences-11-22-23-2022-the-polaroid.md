## The Drive

The convertible struggled to keep the above-limit pace along the Outer-Coastal Interstate that arced along the Gulf of Mexico from Corpus Christi, Texas to Naples, Florida. The 85 MPH speed limit meant nothing 20 miles out from land on the raised highway. Four-laned on each side the crescent concrete roadway relieved traffic pressure from the decaying inland road system. Out here everyone hauled ass.

This 4-cylinder convertible barely made 85 MPH. Tractor trailers and panel vans zipped by in the far two left lanes. She looked in the rear-view constantly in fear of a sports car coming too quickly for a lane change. We stopped at each off-ramp rest station to grab snacks and check the news for any mention of our escape.

Near Tampa we hit the off-coast water conversion plants. The four-lane splits into four separated, above water concrete slim roads, the speed drastically reduced to 30 MPH. It slows again to 10 MPH. The noise of the pumps drowns the streaming music out. We guide the convertible on to hydroplane ferry that navigates the puzzle system of pipes between the conversion intakes and the conversion plants themselves. It’s a back and forth and left and right of avoiding the machinery.

The hydro-ferry terminates at a large parking lot and another rest area. This stop traffic from both directions is mixed. One could turn around and go back from whence they came if they so desired. Nobody comes this far out to turn back. A decision is a decision. There are no vacationers out here. Only truckers, smugglers, and fools escaping the last mistake.

## THE HOUSE

Brown-bricked and three stories not counting the basement. The multi-level home backed into hole sixteen of a highbrow golf course. Sue now the sole owner of this behemoth after the reading of the last will and testament. She invited us to catalog her aunt’s belongings, and sort her own personal things from the hoarded piles of EVERYTHING her aunt collected. Sue took sole care of her aunt the last few years. TV Guides for years. Tupperware holding Tupperware. Bags and bags of stuffed animals separated by some system nobody had figured out yet.

Now Sue also had too many things. Art from most movements, furniture spanning hundreds of years. All of it mixed with no rhyme or reason with pet rocks, AS SEEN ON TV kitchen appliances. The Matisse in the Grand Room had a Snuggie slung over the corner.

She photo-texted me an image of an old Polaroid. R &amp; my hand entwined. Late 1980’s. My right hand on a stick shift nob, R’s fingers, clasped on top of mine. The color had long faded. “Halloween” written in black magic marker on the top white border, “1988” on the bottom.

The starter was broken on the car and I had to back down any incline to start it in reverse, or get a stranger to assist me with starting it forward, popping the clutch in second gear, keeping the motor revved, and moving right along. The soft-top had dry-rotted long ago. We just endured rain, and pulled over any available overpass or tree-cover for heavy storming. Strategic parking every time. And waiting. There’s no rush in a life without time.
