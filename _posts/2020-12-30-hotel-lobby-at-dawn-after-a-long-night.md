Hotel lobby at dawn after a long night. Elevator lights still sting our eyes. Christmas/holiday decorations are up as employees prepare for NYE celebrations at the end of the 1st Plague Year.

*Read your way out of this, Clark. There’s no living escape. . .*

Aircrew catch an early shuttle. Another family eager to check out argues over what was left upstairs in the room.

We balance drugs and alcohol like professional circus clowns: the vaudeville of it all. Either everyone in this lobby knows or none of them do. NO–that child knows. Let’s find a bathroom and disappear again. Pink Palomino must be open by now.
