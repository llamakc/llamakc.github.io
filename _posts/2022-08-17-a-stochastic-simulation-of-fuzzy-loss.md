Love repeats over and over all around us; even when we have become dull instruments of broken receiving array. Greying black patch cords with unmatched connectors. The great tangle of wire and shielding on the side of the Ultra-State highway running 5,000 feet above the terrain just outside of Boulder. We saw the billboards on the Trans-Pacific caterpillar that shuttled us away from a very bad and overpriced dinner in Guam. What a bad decision to travel that far on a recommendation for pot-stickers and unregulated beer.

The caterpillar cutting under the ocean at subsonic, a free ride if you let the ad servers fatten your gear with a week’s worth of persuasion. The better-off opted out with credit or cash. The poor always get fucked. A week’s worth of value-added content: about to commit larceny? Here’s our recommended outfit. . .

We are on the Ultra-State and headed back to the West Coast to gather our things from the latest eviction. Leases grow shorter and shorter as prices rise. This place we managed to keep for three months.

We took turns carrying each other over the threshold. The heart chooses you in every daydream and every past, and I follow only the chimera thrashing inside my heart. They are the path. The blood-borne desire. The virus is the cure. Sweat on our bellies. Laughter when we still listened to each other.

Love repeats over and over. You were happy before me and that meant something. I have been notes of music lost without form.
