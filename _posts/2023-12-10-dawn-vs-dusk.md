Either complain and cry about all of the time I've wasted or start making good with what is left.

The river is rising again. The pumps are at diminished capacity. This place will not exist in 100 years. Chances are my corporal form will not be disposed of in a fashion of my choosing.These are good things: a life that carries on without the delusion of our control or intervention. Let the flotsam pass the jetsam.

I am befriending a crow.
