I do not see a return to pre-pandemic life.

If youâ€™re a tinkering human please check out [Listen to the Radio](https://github.com/llamakc/LttR), a shell script for college radio stations that [Quantifier](http://quantifier.org) and I are favorable of.

Perhaps 2021 will be the year I carve or bully space out of my time, life, living situation to begin painting in earnest. I hope so.

Meanwhile more bits of whatever life was before THIS continue to shed away into the bottom of the hourglass. The sands mixed and copies of one another. Who can tell anything apart any longer? The blue ink stains that show which of us are still tied to every simulation: our minds lost in transit.
