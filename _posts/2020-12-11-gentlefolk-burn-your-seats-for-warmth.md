Blackjack dealer. Fancy hands. Nickname was Pet-food. Promised they would reshuffle my life deck and get things back on track. Returned each payday for Pet-food to light some sage, put on a bit of slow jazz, and dance the oversized playing cards back and forth.

“Not this time, Mr. Ken. You come back next week. Better luck.”

Assume the worst and expect a close facsimile. And pay for it all.
