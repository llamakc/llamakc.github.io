The un-secret police wore dull gray on this October foggy night. A balding undercover already on the public bus seated a couple of rows behind. Let-it-go released puff of air-brakes. My left headphone fell off as the driver jerked to a complete stop. Another thing lost.

The driver’s command voice garbled over the intercom, “Sorry y’all but that bridge ahead is closed ’cause of this weather. I can’t see ahead.” He paused and throated out a few wet coughs, continued “Transfer station is two blocks ahead, other side of the bridge. walk from here.” The door opened and the cabin lights illuminated to full.

Everyone shuffled to grab their bags and carry-ons: each face too bright and seen. The high resolution of real life where faces aren’t behind the dream veil or software touch-ups. The split lips and exczema. A pale teenage boy grabbed his neck to hide a large hickey. His friends laughed and told him not to hide it. Life is there whether we mask it or not.

We shuffled off over the bridge. Buses were parked waiting for the fog to clear, and we waited impatiently to board. Just get home is all everyone wanted. A few to get to work. Maybe a couple of drunks transiting from bar to bar. The fog wasn’t even shut-it-all-down bad. Something else was the reason for the interruption.

A busker was collecting in an old Mardi Gras cup. My eastbound-bus line started to board and I took a place in the haphazard line. Searched each pocket for the other headphone. Gone also.

Grabbed me from behind, rushed to the concrete. Same asshole from before but with a baseball cap on. They aren’t the brilliant ones. The gray secret police surrounded and formed a semi-circle, all talking at once.

“Here is your judgment and punishment, dirtbag!”

“Yeah take your medicine, you goddamn’ loser!” Another chirped. Kicks all around.

“Take his shoes and his sense of self-worth. I got his wallet. Probably got drug shake if not half a bag.” That assailant, or arresting officer’s voice, was effeminate and familiar.

*This bum ain’t got no money. Doesn’t even care about himself. Blind him. Pour acid in his ears. Crack his ribs the way he likes ’em.*
