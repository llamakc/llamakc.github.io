I want to be lost in a revolving, light-trap door between the waking world and a woke sleep-walk darkroom where our insides glow like theyâ€™ve developer still wet in crevices. No more canards &amp; doublespeak.

Say say say it clearly. I am the color between the watch-hands. The moment after it all ended. Stop bath before you climb into bed tonight.
