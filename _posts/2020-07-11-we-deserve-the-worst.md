All of itâ€“a whisper across a crowded room speaking of memories about a dream where the ghosts phased in and out of view. The festival fun-house of weird mirrors and strobe-lights. What is reality anyway?

The chimera need not touch your shoulder: only give the impression they are about to. A feather across the back of her neck. How your senses heighten and you do not know the why.

I think of those who got out of here early by either age or disease, tragedies or their own hand. What long gauze scarves are they spinning about in the ether between worlds? All of it now almost gone completely away. The intimacy left to starve on the sidewalk or bake itself to crust from the sunlight. Friendships became the occasional letter (by text or email, phone- or video-call) and also joined the petrified collection inside our heads to gather more dust. Our own skin settling down to bury us, month after month after endless days that no longer are counted or known in their regular order.

I was miserable and lost before the End began. I am built for survival without your help.
