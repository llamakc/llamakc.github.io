Here we go. Instead of combing through old posts or journals to transcribe into here, I am going to just add some dream notes, random thoughts, but try and stay focused on WHAT this book would be about.

What’s the idea? I want to abandon the gimmick for now. The title means nothing to me.

Research hagstones, bulletproofing a car, the anole’s lifespan and factoids about them. I had one in my dream last night that had babies, and the babies clung onto their mama lizard. (Anole even a lizard by taxonomy?)

So it is JUST a working title and does not need to be a crucial part. LET the gimmick, gimmick.

I want to write about my poor decisions: how living a life of spontaneity has left me unfulfilled. MIND you that I am not unfulfilled now, but I was up until a short time ago. LET this be a fun ride, but a cautionary tale.

I want to use flash-forward and -back.
