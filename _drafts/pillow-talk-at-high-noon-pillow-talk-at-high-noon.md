Somewhere not-coast Florida well after midnight. We stopped for gas and beer, and paid in loose change. Some of the coins still sticky from the center console’s swamp of cigarette ash, water, beer, and food bits. A man could live off of car leftovers if he was inclined or forced to.

The insects swarmed the streetlights and under the pump’s canopy. Thick like you swatted them away to cut a path. On point. The little monsters filled the empty space I’d create like a swarm of fish. So many bugs. You give up and eat some. The Circle of Life is drawn on an Etch-a-Sketch. The Secret of Life is drawn on an Etch-a-Sketch.

He said his name was Stevie with two ee’s. Stevee. We shrugged him off and we walk through a field of high weeds to the convenience store. Stevee walks off behind the building.

C-store nachos &amp; cheese are only bested by nachos at a ballgame. We are loaded up with Mountain Dew, chips, that shitty popcorn with the cheese covering that gets under your fingernails. Stevee is just outside the door swinging a possum by the tail. He’s swaying it back and forth, and to his left and right. His smile is infectious.

“I’m gonna clear this whole parking lot of these mole crickets.”

We were confident they were not mole crickets, but their songs belted out from those ears they have on their legs.

“Eat them all, Mr. Possum!” Stevee hollered.

Now he looped the possum over his head, and made figure eights. The possum screeched and clawed at the air.

“See? He’s reaching for ’em!”

The middle-aged clerk came outside with a broom and threatened to call the cops.

“Ain’t no cops around here and nobody care nothing about a possum or Stevee!” he said as he slowed the possum down to a short circle in front of him.

The clerk was having none of the parking lot shenanigans. She shooed off two underage girls in bikinis drinking wine coolers, and she pulled out her phone.

“Give me that goddamn possum!” she told Stevee.

I opened a can of beer and took a caffeine powder. “Ma’am, I think that boy isn’t right.”

“Oh we know. He’s always here doing dumb shit. Last week he set up turntables and tried to throw a rave.”

“Music is my life!” Stevie shouted with the possum now on the ground but still in his firm possession.

Then the possum gained an angle and bit the hell out of Stevee. “I’ll be right back,” he said.

Then we pumped gas, four dollars in change at a time. We moved the beat-to-shit Chevy to the airpump, and there came Stevee back this time with two possums a-swinging.

“Fuck these mole crickets!” He sang out.
