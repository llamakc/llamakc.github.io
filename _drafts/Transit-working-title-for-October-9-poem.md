(rough guidance: look through phone for 0ctober 9th in the past (since you’ve been in New Orleans)

ABOVE not reliable. I was posting pictures on October 9 of our trips that we took on other dates

Look up other factoids about 10/9 and 10/9/72 specifically

Freewrite about what defines her

she would find you across Times Square at a terrible crossroads of your life, and without choosing for you, help you along your path. She does good things because they matter to her universe, without virtue signals or the comeuppance of social media.

Let the title appear during or after composition

do not re-describe any cliche of location or emotion: FIND the moments between the ACTIONS and examine that.

STRUCTURE: 3 / 4 / 5 repeat (six stanzas total)

two revelations: one regarding R and one myself.

```
<pre class="wp-block-verse">v.1
When summer rains slow we wander a bit—
let the child in us have a few moments
between the sun-bright deluge & humidity

Your reflection in the puddle isn't you, still
there's a pause—the same I wake up and stare
to just take all that you are, in. A persistent
feather of hope. The last good one. A beginning

that 

v.2
Transit

When summer rains relax we wander a bit— 
let the child in us have a few moments 
between a sun-bright deluge and humidity 

Your reflection in the puddle isn't you, 

EXPAND ON S2L1

still
 there's a pause—the ??? same ??? I wake to stare 
and just take all that you are, in. A persistent 
feather of hope. The last good one. A beginning 

that
