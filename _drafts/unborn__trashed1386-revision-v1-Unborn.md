I’ve had enough. This was predictable and expected.

I should have burned every decision and chose differently. I carry only regret past the veil.

And I am well versed in traveling light(er) than before.

<s>Goodbye.</s>

Maybe I need a vacation, and I don’t mean taking my life. Just some time to re-center; to appreciate this world and the wonders to be discovered.

I am tired of being talked to, talked down to. The relentless slog, the word soup fog of my mistakes bouncing around my head both out and in. I give in, I give up. This is not retreat or surrender. I’ve been absorbed by a different path/plan.

Dreams gone. Passion projects abandoned. I do not enjoy this life.
