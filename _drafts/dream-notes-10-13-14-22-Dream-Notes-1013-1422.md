Near-near future: aliens have arrived but only few realize. They’ve coerced/controlled just enough of population to sway opinion that 1) they aren’t even here, and 2) that war with ANYONE else is necessary.

They have a method of realizing and manifesting a person’s nightmare, individual by individual.

When they do arrive their shock troops are seen as Chinese by those who hate the Chinese, Russian by the same, et cetera.

Mass communication has ended. No worldwide television broadcasts. Word of mouth and return to mimeograph physical copy machinery. Morse code in some instances where wire-to-wire still exists and hasn’t been scavenged for 1/100th of pennies on the dollar.

Only coins are used as money. The govt. absorbed all of the paper money and made it obsolete as they went to a digital currency before the attacks began. People have $ cash, but nobody takes. ONLY coinage is trusted now.

The folks who are aware of the aliens are those who have taken Psilocybin, and a person’s awareness depends on their listening to the messages they receive from the mushroom trips. The micro-dose crew are hyper-aware of it all, but seen as whackos by the general populace.

I am able to fly because I willed it so during a psilocybin trip, but only became able to fly AFTER the aliens were known to me. Others have unlocked similar, new skills, with a similar timeline. We think whatever system/method/magick the aliens use to enslave/control the regulars (the regs) has also unlocked our new powers. It isn’t superhero like, but is above normal.

My flights are limited, and directly related to eating. I eat voraciously, but you’d not know it from my #2 pencil-thin frame. If I gorge on a filling meal (candy is no help, beer is useless) I get 15-30 minutes of good flying. When my strength wanes I am up and down just above the ground: a pitiful flying stick of bone and long hair.

The nightmares they induce are more selective by pulling certain elements of one’s dreams and making them real. You won’t be haunted by a full dream, but a bit of it. Perhaps heads on stakes in a public place where they should not be. They deploy the meat-hooks from Hellraiser franchise. I have to pull one from my front, left shoulder and the other from my right hip. The chains retract when free, and clang against each other as they pulled away out of sight.

It is insidious and causes anxiety and fear. Everyone self-medicates. The world has already ended and we are caught in the molasses of a slow-motion apocalypse.

Time-shift or restart of dream: A 747 jumbojet makes a landing in a clearing adjacent to the (college, military, civilian workforce?) dorms. Curiosity leads people to its resting spot, but the aircraft is now blocked by a tall, metallic fence that has appeared along its perimeter. We all know the fence is mysteriously new. Nobody remembers its construction.

I tell my group of friends I’m going to fly up to the roof some five stories high, but must eat first. They offer junk food, and I express I need better sustenance to fly. They humor me and a redheaded young woman wearing a pink beret brings me a roast beef poboy cut into quarters. She eats 1/2 as I do.

Her stare seems off. I wonder if she’s been coerced by the aliens. She shows me a cute little mushroom tattoo on the underside of her right forearm–a piece of flash art and nothing unique. I have the same tattoo in the exact same place. I show her and we laugh while finishing off the last quarters of the poboy.

We are on the lawn adjacent to one of the several dorms. Reclined on a patchwork comforter, and watching the clouds. People are discussing in furtive whispers on how to get a good view over the wall. The forest line blocks the aircraft, its large tail the only visible sign it even landed. Government grey with no markings.

Speculation begins: some think the French have attacked, some the Mexicans, and others a conglomerate of African countries. Nobody suspects the United States, or aliens.

“See that cloud there straight up from the water tower?” She nudges me for attention. “That is an opossum who is searching for a mate.”

I reply in the negative that I do not see a possum. “A small rodent perhaps. A gerbil?”

“No, no it’s a possum. Was in my dream the other night. That’s how I know,” she says assuredly.

“If you say so, I won’t argue.” We sit in silence a few minutes longer. “Hey what’s your name? I’m KEN.”

“Ugh no, no. I hate my name. Any question but that!”

“Okay no worries, but I dunno how a name could be that bad considering all of the craziness that’s happened world-wide lately.”

She pursed her lips in contemplation. “You’re absolutely right. It’s just a name.” She touched my tattoo with thin fingers, and paused with her mouth slightly open. “Mary. Boring ass Mary.”

I smiled at Mary. An uncomplicated name for an overly complicated weekend. “It’s perfect. . .Now watch this–“

I stood up, crouched slightly down, and thrust myself ten feet in the air, hovering. Gasps and a few claps from the immediate handful of people. I floated down, and told them I’d go to the rooftop of the last dorm that fronted the treeline, and up I went.

- - - - - -

Flying wasn’t some superhero action movie skill for me. I didn’t gain much altitude, and regularly had to relaunch. To go long distances I needed many landings and takeoffs. Each flight a bit more steady than its prior. After a few hops from dorm to dorm I reached the Hayworth Residential Housing Facility. Each building named after a woman of fame or success. I took a scout’s position on the non-facing slope, and peered above the ridge.

The aircraft was gone. There must have been nearly fifty squadrons of troops in formation. I could not determine their origin. All wore dark gray uniforms with no cover, which I found odd.

Suddenly the airplane reappeared, phasing into sight the way a hologram comes and goes.

A cloaking device I whispered only to myself. I jumped off the five story dorm and regained flight right before impact. They won’t believe any of this. I decided I’d tell my friends, and for selfish reasons, Mary, first before flying over to the campus police substation.

- - - - - -

“It’s there, but it isn’t. You can’t see it unless it de-cloaks. From what I saw, it had to do so to let a group of soldiers re-enter the rear of the aircraft.”

“Soldiers?!” One of the younger college boys asked. “What the fuck!”

They didn’t believe the plane could carry 1000 soldiers, and jokingly quipped I must be hallucinating to believe that an entire aircraft could hide itself. They implored me to fly closer and determine where they came from.

Mary agreed with them. “Please, Ken? We are really worried now.” She touched my shoulders in the familiar way of long-acquainted friends or lovers.

“I’ll need more food, I replied, and she grabbed my hand leading me into the dorm.

- - - - - -

 The room’s walls were bare save a single dry erase board covered in gibberish. She and her roommate shared a small common area and bathroom with two other sub-rooms. None of the other ladies were around.

“I’m going to make you some oatmeal, and cut some fruit up for it also. And a PB&amp;J on wheat for even extra energy.” She said with her head buried in a mini-fridge. “What type of jelly? Oops scratch that we only have orange marmalade.”

A grape jelly man myself, I didn’t offer up any complaint. Food was energy and this wasn’t the time to be picky. I watched her prepare the meal, and I took in her exuberant beauty. Always the redheads, right?

We stayed in the common room, and sat on the floor with our backs against a tattered couch. She would turn her head slightly away when smiling. It was too late. Mary had my full attention.

- - - - - -

A light knock on her door and it opened. The entire eight-plus group from earlier poured into the room. They wanted answers, soon.

I had no desire to get closer to the troops and risk detection. I figured I could get to a taller tree about half-way between the clearing and the dorm for a better view.

“I’m guessing none of y’all have binoculars.”

No replies. A bottle-blonde lady handed me a point &amp; shoot 35mm camera. “The zoom on this may work.”

We travel this life with what we have, and not what we dream of.

“Here, take this,” Mary said softly in a room full of several conversations. Gently she grabbed my wrist and attached a used concert wristband, securing it with some pink duct tape. “Good luck,” and there in the company of all of her friends she kissed me for what seemed like several minutes.

- - - - - -

I’m jump-flying, coasting, drifting roof to roof again with an immutable smile. I knew I would kiss her today the moment she began to speak. The confident softness of her tone that withheld judgment and invited opinion.

Paused behind the last dorm’s ridge, I eyeball my next move. Landing in trees is difficult, and even more a struggle to push off to the next landing. The tree gives, the branches are unsteady or sometimes crack and send me off-balance to the hardpack ground. I’m going to move slowly and stay between the trunks with the hope of doing so stealthily.

From the ridge I view half the troops as before. They could have reloaded, or spread out. They may be closing in on the campus. No sound of heavy machinery, or forest noise of clumsy enlistees cutting and stomping their way through vines and undergrowth.

Wait, they no longer are outfitted in dark grey. Their uniforms now a camouflage of traditional green and tan swatches. I slide over the roof ridge, and push headlong between the branches, hoping for a successful landing in the Y of a sturdy tree.

Success. Hugging the cottonwood branches, get my bearings and survey the forest. Perhaps two more jumps and I’ll get a good look at the troops still at parade rest.
