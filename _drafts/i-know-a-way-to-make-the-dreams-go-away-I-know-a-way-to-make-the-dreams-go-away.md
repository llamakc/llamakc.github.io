Hi. I am a shepherd of adults and children. I make sure these worlds operate in a fashion of their choosing. No, not magick. I mean the dull chores and logistics of material support.

*I drink tap water from the bathroom sink.*

I clean, wash laundry &amp; dishes; I feed &amp; water the animals. I walk the ones that require such, and ignore the cats.

*Ignoring these cats are one of my few Earthly pleasures.*

*I need a hobby, and need to be social.*

Every day, for years. The same routine. Each season that passes I lose a facet off my designed cut. Self-chipped and self-guided. No laboratory-grown gems inside this heart of hearts. But each season something falls away.

There is no medicine. There is nothing but another morning where the dreams dissipate, and all of the dust and grime reappear. It is the cycle of submission. The boring out of whatever fanciful thoughts and ideas made their way into my conscious mind during my youth. BE GONE, DRAGONS!

*Be gone dragon, dinosaur, and robot!*
