They asked why I use a pencil and paper for day math. I half-flash a poor smile. The best defense is pretending. You start this as soon as you grasp a sense of self, and unfortunately, others.

Relationships are founded on the *what if* and the *but wait*. You’ll learn to listen better. You’ll allow space for your lover to be upset in the same way you complain.

The only constant in this universe is you.

I prefer a soft pencil because it gives. A young man in the late 1990’s was forced to write right-handed in most rural elementary school systems. A slap on the hand or head. The triangular, plastic-rubber slip-on sleeves that made writing *as I did naturally`* uncomfortable.

Creatures adapt or go away to the emptiness that either is between this and that, or the emptiness after this. Really don’t change a damn thing. EMPTINESS is its own challenge..

 My left arm curled snake-style where I wrote upside down. What’ s wrong with knowing the backwardness of this world before all of y’all. I knew then that everything right was wrong. Just like in that old, old story. . .

My company ID says CONTRACT GO-BETWEEN which means no toothy fixin’, and no paid days off because I feel yuck-yuck. If I break a footer it is a footer I will have to limp on and along while doing this go-between bullshit.

The Protection Division of the Conglomerated States of South North America won’t chat it up with the whack-job journalists. They just won’t anymore. And then there’s me.

I am well-rewarded even though there’s no company bennies. Most of that overpay goes to saucing up and softening the cops and administrative police body to provide information on what’s going on or what’s coming next. Mostly they give up days’ old information. That type of data doesn’t get me any kickbacks from the journies who hit my phones up all day long. The phones never stop binging, ringing, singing, or knocking.

I store them in my sock and sex toy drawer at night: five phones constantly buzzing against one another. It is like two vibrators at the same time struggling to give off the 10,177 buzzes that shut this world out. That moment when the pupils dilate. It is the only drug worth chasing, and when the clarity arrives: OH if the planet could have one simultaneous orgasm.

“I’d like to buy the world an orgasm in perfect harmony.”

Some Go-Betweens work the company-to-public angle. You gonna slant one way or the other. Nobody ever really met another person they didn’t decide how they valued that individual.

A person can be quite wrong on first impressions, but you sorted them anyway. And you sorted them again. All your life deciding whether people are dicks, cunts, or golden. There’s more good on Earth than you meet, but the shitty folk really have a way of upending this equation.

And you’re no different. You get known to be what you are no matter how you try to bend the future. Boy, you is what you is. Stop fighting and go be happy. I like to lie about what the cops are doing, and I make a small living at doing so. This is better than sucking dicks for money to buy pussy.

*Never look backward to move forward.*

Some days I get a hooker just to have somebody to talk to at dinner. All the time they’re negotiating condom on or off, blowie or butthole. Listen: let’s just enjoy the glass of red and eat these mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat. *But what about piss-play? That’s only 25 extra.*

I have a shielded boot I hide my knife and messaging watch inside when I get wrangled through courthouse security. Been doing this twenty years and same asshole cops gotta try and play tough-guy. That’s their gig now. No longer harassing folk for a busted tail-light and escalating that to a resisting charge. They froth at the mouth at somebody breaking the rules &amp; protocols. Joe Everyday comes in to get a marriage license and spends ten useless minutes because the cop whose wife leaves mayonnaise out all night (and is slowly poisoning him) needs to pat him down repeatedly. Fucking cops. A buddy got three days in jail for forgetting to empty his pockets. The cop didn’t like his attitude.

These are the dumbfucks I play interpreter to journalists for. I take a multi-layered question and break it down in to 2nd grade, low word count, binary questions. That’s to get them talking. It’s the agreement that brings down their guard. A beer after work. Some chips from the machine that still owes the 2 bucks.

And I gotta be part-time xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic. If they knew me they would push me down a flight of stairs. I feel that sentiment spreads to many people I know. I anger-buy the right clothes and hate-eat at the places a rube would eat. I am the loudest mime. The quietest side-show barker. The Joker’s jester’s assistant.

I scribe my scratchy notes on a small reporter’s notebook. I bought them in bulk from an office supply store that went out of business the way all businesses eventually die. Disappeared from the Earth by Time. Sharpening the pencils had to be done by scissor-scrape, which broke pencils so I carried a dozen, a thick rubberband holding them firmly. The dipshit cops won’t allow a plastic sharpener to go beyond their single checkpoint. I could kill a motherfucker with that blade.

Just to stand around and wait to catch a ADA at the snack machine, or sneaking off for a quick smoke; just to be ignored.

An industrious GB knew the quick way was a simple bribe. Most folk can be turned in any direction with the simplest and most basic methods that give them the warm fuzzies. An easy third of my professional life was juggling gifts. I required an actual cornucopia filled with cash cards, tickets to upcoming events,
